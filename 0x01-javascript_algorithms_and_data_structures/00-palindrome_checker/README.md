A lightweight, fast, and free web app to check if a word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome. Palindromes are strings that read the same forward and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spaces.

- Support for quick checking by pressing the Enter key
- Error handling for empty user input

### :hammer_and_wrench: Technologies Used
