# Front-End Development Libraries

A collection of projects completed while learning some popular front-end frameworks and libraries.

### 00. :brain::speech_balloon: Random Quote Machine

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/

> Use whichever libraries or APIs you need.<br>
> You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery.

**User Stories:**

- I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding `id="quote-box"`
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="text"`
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="author"`
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="new-quote"`
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding `id="tweet-quote"`
- On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`
- On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`
- When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
- My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the `#new-quote` button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.
- I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` `a` element. This `a` element should include the `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` path in its `href` attribute to tweet the current quote.
- The `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

> <sub>**Note:** Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the `target="_blank"` or `target="_top"` attribute on the `#tweet-quote` element if your tweet won't load. `target="_top"` will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.</sub>
